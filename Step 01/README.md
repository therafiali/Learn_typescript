What is a variable?
In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.

* Variable means anything that can vary.
* A TypeScript variable is simply a name of storage location. 
* A variable must have a unique name. 

* A variable name can't contain any spaces
* A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.
* The first character must be a letter, or an underscore (-), or a dollar sign ($).
* Numbers are not allowed as the first character of variable.



for example:

usa = united states of america
let nam = Raja
_age = 17
&gender = male 
nam = ali
The keyword "let" in Javascript is used to declare a variable that is block scoped in JavaScript. In JavaScript, the var keyword is typically used to declare a variable that is treated like any other variable, whereas variables declared using the let in JavaScript are block scoped.
for example:

let a = "apple";  //double quotes allowed

let r = 'Raja';   //single also quotes allowed

let r = "Rafi";      // reassigning allowed in let 


The "const" declaration declares block-scoped local variables. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment using the assignment operator, but if a constant is an object, its properties can be added, updated, or removed.

for example:
const usa = 'United States Of America';
const x = "John"; //single or double quotes also allowed.

x = 'Alex';  //cannot be reassigned because const is constant.















let a:string = "apple";  
let x:number = 2;
let isValid:boolean = true
let y:boolean = false


The console. log() is a function in JavaScript that is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user. 
Syntax: console. log("")
