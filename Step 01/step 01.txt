What is a variable?
In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.

for example:

usa = united states of america
name = Raja
age = 17
gender = male 

The keyword "let" in Javascript is used to declare a variable that is block scoped in JavaScript. In JavaScript, the var keyword is typically used to declare a variable that is treated like any other variable, whereas variables declared using the let in JavaScript are block scoped.
for example:

let a = "apple";  //double quotes allowed

let r = 'Raja';   //single also quotes allowed

r = "Rafi";      // reassigning allowed in let 


The "const" declaration declares block-scoped local variables. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment using the assignment operator, but if a constant is an object, its properties can be added, updated, or removed.

for example:
const usa = 'United States Of America';
const x = "John"; //single or double quotes also allowed.

x = 'Alex';  //cannot be reassigned because const is constant.















let a:string = "apple";  
let x:number = 2;
let isValid:boolean = true
let y:boolean = false


The console. log() is a function in JavaScript that is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user. 
Syntax: console. log("")
