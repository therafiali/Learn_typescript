# Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used in programming to perform mathematical operations on numbers. Here's a brief overview of commonly used arithmetic operators:

- **Addition (+):** This operator is used to add two numbers together.

- **Subtraction (-):** This operator is used to subtract one number from another.

- **Multiplication (*):** This operator is used to multiply two numbers together.

- **Division (/):** This operator is used to divide one number by another.

- **Exponential (**):** This operator is used to raise a number to a power.

- **Modulus (%):** This operator is used to find the remainder when one number is divided by another.

# Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Here are some commonly used assignment operators:

- **Assignment (=):** This operator assigns a value to a variable. For example: `let n = 5;`

- **Addition Assignment (+=):** This operator adds a value to the current value of a variable and assigns the result back to the variable. For example: `n += 5;` is the same as `n = n + 5;`

- **Subtraction Assignment (-=):** This operator subtracts a value from the current value of a variable and assigns the result back to the variable. For example: `n -= 5;` is the same as `n = n - 5;`

# Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values and return boolean results (true or false). Here are commonly used comparison operators:

- **Equal (==):** This operator checks if two values are equal in value (not necessarily in type).

- **Strict Equal (===):** This operator checks if two values are equal in both value and type.

- **Not Equal (!=):** This operator checks if two values are not equal in value (not necessarily in type).

- **Greater Than (>):** This operator checks if one value is greater than another.

- **Less Than (<):** This operator checks if one value is less than another.

- **Greater Than or Equal To (>=):** This operator checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.

- **Less Than or Equal To (<=):** This operator checks if one value is less than or equal to another.

# Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. They are often used to control the flow of a program. Here are some common logical operators:

- **Logical AND (&&):** This operator returns true if both operands are true.

- **Logical OR (||):** This operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true.

- **Logical NOT (!):** This operator negates the value of the operand, turning true into false and vice versa.

Understanding these operators is essential for writing and understanding code in programming languages. They are building blocks for creating complex logic and calculations in your programs.
